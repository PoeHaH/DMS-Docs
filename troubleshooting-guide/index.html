                    <h1 id="troubleshooting-guide">Troubleshooting Guide</h1>
<p>These are all the troubleshooting steps you can follow in order to resolve any issues experienced with Domain Mapping System.</p>
<h2 id="contacting-support">Contacting Support</h2>
<p>Before <a href="https://domainmappingsystem.com/request-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contacting support</a> with any questions about how domain mapping, DNS, or server configuration works, please read the guide in detail below. We don't expect everyone to know the ins-and-outs of these complex details, but this guide will help you.</p>
<p>If you still can't get the plugin working, feel free to reach out by reviewing the details below. However, sometimes a quick question can save hours of time. We're here to provide as much valuable knowledge as possible.</p>
<p>In some cases, more advanced diagnosis is required to determine the cause of any issues, for which we request your patience. This is a complex plugin and there are thousands of server environments, WordPress configurations, and potential conflicts with 3rd party plugins or themes.</p>
<p>If you have purchased the plugin, we promise to provide priority support and fully determine the <strong>exact cause</strong> of any issues via the troubleshooting steps below and/or with developer support, if necessary. We request that you attempt as many of the steps below as possible and fully read through the troubleshooting guide, as it provides a wealth of information in a condensed format.</p>
<p>If you have not yet purchased the plugin, we will still do our best to help you resolve any issues, but this troubleshooting guide should be adequate in 99% of cases for both free and paid customers.</p>
<p>Generally, any issues with the plugin fall into a few major categories, which we've tried to describe in a relatable way in each title below. You might want to start by reading the section most relevant to any issues you're experiencing. Please be sure to read about Caching first.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-disabling-caching-or-clearing-your-cache">The Importance of Disabling Caching or Clearing your Cache</h2>
<p>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps below or making any kind of change and then running a test, it's important to ensure you clear the cache at all levels (server, website, CDN, or browser) <strong>prior</strong> to running a test. An even better alternative is to altogether disable caching while configuring Domain Mapping System.</p>
<p>Some hosting companies (like WordPress.com) may not allow you to clear your cache or control caching, depending on the plan. If they don't offer the option, it's not a requirement in order to run tests, but just be sure to deactivate caching at all levels where you have access to do so.</p>
<p>Once you have everything working with Domain Mapping System, you can always re-enable caching, and you should not have any issues keeping caching enabled moving forward.</p>
<p>Read more about caching in <a href="/common-issues/caching/">this related doc</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-dns-server-troubleshooting">Basic DNS/Server Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Please proceed through these troubleshooting steps to ensure everything is configured properly:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check your DNS settings for both your primary domain and any mapped domains. The A Records should match exactly.</li>
<li>Ensure that you have configured your mapped domain as an Alias Domain or Addon Domain in your server configuration settings (cPanel, etc).</li>
<li>Double check your mapping settings in the Domain Mapping System plugin settings area.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mapped-domain-is-redirecting-or-showing-an-insecure-website-warning">Mapped Domain is Redirecting or Showing an Insecure Website Warning</h2>
<p>If you find that your mapped domain is redirecting to your primary site domain or you are getting an insecure website warning in your browser, please attempt the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure you have a <a href="/integrations-and-compatibility/supported-hosting-platforms/">supported hosting company</a> that offers alias domains that do not redirect.</li>
<li>Clear cache at all levels, including Server, Website, CDN, and Browser, and then open the website in an incognito window to test if the issue persists.</li>
<li>Ensure you have an SSL certificate set up properly for all domains. Run a test by accessing your site via &quot;http&quot; and &quot;https&quot; independently in the URL bar. Sometimes the SSL certificate may not be configured properly, causing a redirect when using the secure version, and perhaps not when using the insecure version. Contact your hosting provider for assistance with SSL for alias domains.</li>
<li>Ensure you have the <a href="https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/htaccess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default .htaccess WordPress configuration</a>, so the .htaccess file is not forcing redirects.</li>
<li>Attempt to rename the index.php file to see if it's causing undesired redirects.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="mapped-domain-is-not-showing-primary-site">Mapped Domain is Not Showing Primary Site</h2>
<p>If you find that your mapped domain is improperly displaying your primary site and your DNS settings are properly configured, it indicates a server misconfiguration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that your domain is set up as an Alias Domain.</li>
<li>Ensure that your WordPress platform, all plugins, and all themes are updated to their latest versions.</li>
<li>Ensure there is <strong>not</strong> a second website installation for your mapped domain and delete any &quot;extra&quot; directories specifically set up for any mapped domains. All domains should be rooted to the primary site's WordPress installation. <strong>Be careful not to delete the primary website folder, and always ensure you have a full backup before deleting anything.</strong></li>
<li>Contact your hosting company to check if the configuration settings are setup properly for your mapped Domain. Ask them: &quot;I want to ensure that my Alias or Addon Domain is properly rooted to my primary domain website folder. Is there anything that would be preventing this from happening on my server?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="critical-errors-or-mapped-domain-is-working-but-some-content-is-displaying-improperly">Critical Errors or Mapped Domain is Working but Some Content is Displaying Improperly</h2>
<p>Some other causes of conflicts can be plugins, themes, or .htaccess configuration.</p>
<h3 id="reverting-to-the-default-wordpress-configuration">Reverting to the Default WordPress Configuration</h3>
<ol>
<li>Reverting to the default WordPress configuration can resolve many issues.
<ol>
<li>Take a full backup of your website.</li>
<li>Attempt to deactivate all other plugins except Domain Mapping System and activate a default WordPress theme. If you're mapping to Products or a post type generated by another plugin, keep WooCommerce or that plugin activated.</li>
<li>Some plugins or themes may leave .htaccess configuration settings. Try to revert your .htaccess file to the to the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/htaccess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default WordPress .htaccess content</a>.</li>
<li>If you've used previous versions of Domain Mapping System, select the option to &quot;Delete plugin, data, and settings (full removal) when uninstalling.&quot; and then fully delete the plugin from your site. Install the latest <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/domain-mapping-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free version</a> or paid version from your <a href="https://users.freemius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Account</a> area (this portal can be accessed using the original email address used for purchase) and set up your mapped pages again. This will ensure data stored in some previous database entries utilized by the plugin are not causing issues.</li>
<li>Clear your cache at all levels and check if the issue persists in an incognito window.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If the issue persists, open a support ticket by following the steps at the end of this guide.</li>
<li>If the issue is resolved:
<ol>
<li>Reactivate each plugin one by one, clearing the cache after each activation and running a test each time. Activate your theme and any plugins it requires at the end of the process. Following this process will indicate which plugin or theme is causing the conflict.</li>
<li>Open a ticket by the following the steps below and inform us about which plugin or theme is causing the conflict. We'll see what we can do to get it resolved. Usually, there are a few possible options:
<ul>
<li>We can release a fix in our plugin, or</li>
<li>Contact the other development team behind the conflicting theme or plugin to see if they can release a fix, or</li>
<li>In rare situations, we can suggest another plugin or theme to use. However, this should not be necessary, and in most cases there is a workaround solution of some kind. It is our goal to reduce these conflicts with the proper code so you can use any combination of plugins and themes you want.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
